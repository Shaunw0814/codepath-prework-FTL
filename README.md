## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played (optional checkmark allowing users to opt for random or not)
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Introduced indicators that light up for user input (above the keys, light up as green)
- [ ] Added keybinds to the buttons that are also compatible with the game logic (works with the guessing process)
- [ ] Made random patterns an optional feature users can opt in/out of
- [ ] Added hearts that update according to mistakes left
- [ ] Piano keys light up only during game pattern playing the pattern, not user input
- [ ] Alert messages to inform user if they will be challenged against the Fur Elise piano pattern or a randomly generated pattern
- [ ] Defaulted pattern to Fur Elise unless specified by checkbox
- [ ] Checkbox unchecks upon reset (clicking stop, winning, and losing)
- [ ] Added GIF as background with a blur in center to help focus on instructions
